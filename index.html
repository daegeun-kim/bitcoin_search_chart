            Phase 1 – Blockchain Curiosity (2015 – 2017)<br>
            <br>
            Period: ≈ Jan 2015 → Dec 2017
            Dominant keyword: “blockchain”
            Public focus: Foundational understanding of distributed ledger technology.
            Narrative: People explore what blockchain is and how it works; curiosity 
            is technological rather than financial. Bitcoin is still niche; NFT is nearly 
            invisible.<br>
            <br>
            Phase 2 – Bitcoin Confidence & Market Normalization (2019 – 2020)<br>
            <br>
            Period: ≈ Jan 2019 → Dec 2020
            Dominant keyword: “bitcoin price”
            Public focus: Crypto becomes more familiar; skepticism fades.
            Narrative: After the 2018 crash, interest revives as institutional players 
            enter and the concept of cryptocurrency stabilizes. Searches focus on price 
            movement and legitimacy, not basic technology.<br>
            <br>
            Phase 3 – NFT Explosion (2021 – Mid 2022)<br>
            <br>
            Period: ≈ Jan 2021 → Jun 2022
            Dominant keyword: “NFT”
            Public focus: Cultural adoption and speculation.
            Narrative: NFTs dominate global attention; searches peak around Beeple’s $69 
            M sale, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and celebrity endorsements. Blockchain fades 
            into background vocabulary.<br>
            <br>
            Phase 4 – Post-NFT Correction & Bitcoin Maturity (Late 2022 – 2024)<br>
            <br>
            Period: ≈ Sep 2022 → Dec 2024
            Dominant keyword: “bitcoin price” (steady baseline)
            Public focus: Return to fundamentals.
            Narrative: After NFT hype collapses, people shift back to Bitcoin as a stable,
            long-term asset; interest in blockchain revives slightly in enterprise contexts 
            but overall attention cools.<br>
