        Bitcoin's market cycles have repeatedly coincided with waves of public attention. One way to observe that attention is through keyword search volume: when prices accelerate, 
        more people tend to search for related terms (“bitcoin price,” “blockchain,” “NFT”), and when markets cool, interest often fades as well. Search volume is not the same as real adoption, 
        but it is a useful proxy for awareness, hype, and curiosity, especially around major events, news, and speculative bubbles. By viewing price and search activity together, 
        we can compare how market movements and public attention rise, peak, and decline across time.<br>

        Instead of a plain line chart over time, the main visualization maps price against relative search interest and traces the relationship day-by-day. 
        Although the chart is not as informative and clear, this makes it easier to see clustering, lagging behavior, and phase changes, moments when attention grows faster than price, 
        or when price rises while interest stays flat. Last but not least, it allowes a fun visualization for how individual traces create unique artworks.<br>
